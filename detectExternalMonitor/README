#### AUTHOR ####
This script has been developed by:
	Matteo 'Peach' Pescarin

#### REQUIREMENTS ####
disper-0.2.3
	see: http://willem.engen.nl/projects/disper/
xosd-2.2
	see: https://sourceforge.net/projects/libxosd/
xrandr-1.3

#### Other requirements ####
Check disper documentation for other requirements (as of today I must
assume the only one is having a nVidia card).
You also need a RANDR-capable Xorg installation.

#### HOW IT WORKS ####
This program will cycle through:
 1) single monitor
 2) extended monitor on external
 3) only external monitor
 
if using -check flag it will check if there's a monitor connected
and, if it's in use, it will enable the dual view as extended monitor
